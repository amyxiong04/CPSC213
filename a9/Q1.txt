The time taken to perform 10 reads is 0m0.121s, 0m0.114s, and 0m0.008s for real, user, and system respectively. Let's increase the number of reads to 100. The time is now 0m1.119s, 0m1.101s, and 0m0.005s. For 1000 reads, the program execution time becomes: 0m10.952s, 0m10.948s, and 0m0.002s for real, user, and sys respectively.Based on the observed execution time, we observe some patterns in the program's performance. We note that the execution time increases with more reads; as the number of reads increases, the real, user, and system times all show an increasing trend. The increasing execution time is due to the waiting time for disk I/O opertions to complete; as the number of reads increases, the program must wait longer for the increased number of disk read operations to complete. Furthermore, we observe that the increase in the execution time is roughly proportional to the increase in the number of reads. For instance, increasing from 10 to 100 reads approximately increases the time by a factor of 10, and the same goes for increasing the number of reads from 100 to 1000. The program involves some waiting time, as in all three cases, the real time is higher than the user and system time. The above stated observations/patterns could potentially be explained by the is_read_pending loop. This busy-waiting loop consumes CPU resources and wastes CPU time while waiting for the disk I/O operations to complete.
